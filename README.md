The Express backend REST API component of an app to find the nearest places selling tea - "Find me tea". The API receives HTTP requests from a React frontend (see the frontend code here: https://github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/find-me-tea) and then returns the Google Maps API key or gets locations of places selling tea from the Google Maps Places API (Nearby Search).

I later converted this project to be hosted on Amazon Web Services using Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route53, API Gateway and AWS Lambda. I provisioned and configured resources using Terraform. To see the Terraform configuration visit: https://github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/find-me-tea-terraform
