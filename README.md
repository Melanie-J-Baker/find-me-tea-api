"Find me tea" is an app to find the nearest places selling tea. This is the Express backend component of the project, which receives HTTP requests from a React frontend (see the frontend code here: https://github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/find-me-tea) and then either return the Google Maps API key or get locations of places selling tea from the Google Maps Places API. All infrastructure is provisioned and configured using Terraform (see the code here: https://github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/find-me-tea-terraform), with frontend code being hosted on Amazon S3, and backend code deployed via Lambda functions using the Amazon API Gateway.
